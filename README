The Lost Rodent
===============

This is a simple directory listing script that allows you to emulate the
look of how the Mozilla project used to render pages from Gopherspace. It
is designed to give the user slightly more control over the look of their
directories and to enable directory listing on servers where it is disabled.

Installation is very straightforward.

Rename htaccess to .htaccess, then put it and index.php in the folder from
which you would like to enable indexes. The .htaccess file links all subfolders
back to index.php, allowing endless recursion. All paths which are not a file
will be passed to The Lost Rodent. If the path is a directory, The Lost Rodent
will return an index. If the path doesn't exist, it will return an Error 404.

To add descritions to a directory, create a .note file. This file is not
inherited by subdirectories. You can assign descriptions to files by adding a
.files. Templates for each are included with this source code.
